excerpt: 'We collected the largest cerebellum DNAm dataset (N = 752) to date. We found the respective epigenetic ages are all severely underestimated by six representative DNAm age clocks, with the underestimation effects more pronounced in the four clocks whose training datasets do not include brain-related tissues. We identified 613 age-associated CpGs in the cerebellum. We built BrainCortexClock to prove that a single DNAm clock can unbiasedly estimate DNAm ages of both cerebellum and cerebral cortex, when adequately and equally represented in the training dataset. Comparing ageing rates across tissues using DNA methylation multi-tissue clocks is flawed. The large underestimation of age prediction for cerebellums by previous clocks mainly reflects the improper usage of these age clocks. There exist strong and consistent ageing effects on the cerebellar methylome, and we suggest the smaller number of age-associated CpG sites in the cerebellum is largely attributed to its extremely low average cell replication rates.'
