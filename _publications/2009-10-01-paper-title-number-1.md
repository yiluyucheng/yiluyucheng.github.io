excerpt: 'We presented a two-step sex-unbiased data normalization strategy for normalizing DNA methylation microarray samples, which can be applied into almost all quantile-based normalization methods. By this strategy, the autosomal CpGs are normalized independently and separately from the sex chromosome CpGs, while the corrected values of sex chromosomes CpGs are estimated as the weighted average of the corrected methylation values of their nearest neighbor atusosomal CpGs.'
