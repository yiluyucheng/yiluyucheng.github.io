Education
======
* Ph.D in Computer Science, University of Essex, UK, 2019.10-2023.06
* M.S. in Developmental Biology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China, 2012.09-2015.06
* B.S. in Soil and Water Conservation, Beijing Forestry University, China, 2008.09-2012.06


Work experience
======
* Post-doctoral Fellow (2023.03-present)
  * Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, University of Oxford.
  * Utilizing bioinformatic analysis of multi-omic sequencing data to investigate the role of RNA modifiers in cancer, with a specific focus on RNA methyltransferases in colorectal cancer.
    
* Research Officer (2021.04-2022.04)
  * University of Essex, UK
  * Responsibilities included developing automated algorithms and tools for remote sensing image analysis to support snow coverage assessment and crop type mapping.

* Graduate Laboratory Assistant (2020-2021)
  * University of Essex, UK
  * Courses include: Machine learning, Natural Language Engineering, Computer Security

* Senior Bioinformatics Engineer (2016.09-2019.09)
  * Berry Genomics Co. Ltd., China
  * Berry Genomics is a leading Chinese biotech company offering non-invasive prenatal genetic tests for pregnant women. I was responsible for developing algorithms to improve the accuracy and detection limits of NIPT, since then I developed several machine learning models to accurately predict foetal DNA fraction in maternal plasma which greatly benefits the interpretation of the NIPT results.
